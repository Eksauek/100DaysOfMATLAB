# Using MATLAB on the Cloud

MATLAB can be used on the cloud, which allows you to access MATLAB from anywhere with an internet connection. This is useful for remote work, collaboration, or when you do not have access to a local installation of MATLAB. In this guide, we will go through the steps to use MATLAB on the cloud.

## MATLAB on the Cloud

There are several options for using MATLAB on the cloud, including:
- MATLAB Online: a web-based version of MATLAB that can be accessed through a web browser.
- MATLAB on `Amazon Web Services (AWS)`: MATLAB can be run on AWS using pre-configured virtual machines.
- MATLAB on `Microsoft Azure`: MATLAB can be run on Microsoft Azure using pre-configured virtual machines.
- MATLAB on other cloud platforms: Some cloud platforms, such as `Google Cloud Platform` and `IBM Cloud`, offer MATLAB as a pre-configured virtual machine.

## Using MATLAB Online

MATLAB Online is a web-based version of MATLAB that can be accessed through a web browser. Here are the steps to use MATLAB Online:

- Go to the [MATLAB Online website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html) and sign in with your MathWorks account.
- Once signed in, you can create a new MATLAB session or open an existing session.
- MATLAB Online has most of the features of the desktop version of MATLAB, including the command window, editor, and plotting tools.
- You can upload and download files from your computer, and MATLAB Online also includes cloud storage for saving and sharing MATLAB files.
